OBJECT/HUMAN PRESENCE DETECTION USING ARDUINO UNO AND ULTRASONIC SENSOR

         When the object comes within the range of the ultrasonic sensor the buzzer beeps and the led lights up indicating detection of the object .
         
                  
COMPONENTS USED

1.LED (red)
2.resistor -330ohm
3.buzzer - 5v
4.Arduino UNO 
5.UltraSonic sensor -HC-SR04 
6.Connecting wires


CONNECTION

   The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Module has 4 pins, Ground, VCC, Trig and Echo. The Ground and the VCC pins of the module needs to be connected to the Ground and the 5 volts pins on the Arduino Board respectively and the trig and echo pins to any Digital I/O pin on the Arduino Board.

The HC-SR04 sensor attach to the Breadboard
The Sensor VCC connect to the Arduino Board +5V
The Sensor GND connect to the Arduino Board GND
The Sensor Trig connect to the Arduino Board Digital I/O 9
The Sensor Echo connect to the Arduino Board Digital I/O 10

Buzzer and LED
The Buzzer attach to the Breadboard
The Buzzer long leg (+) connect to the Arduino Board Digital 11
The Buzzer short leg (-) connect to the Arduino Board GND
The LED attach to the Breadboard
The Resistor connect to the LED long leg (+)
The Resistor other leg (from LED's long leg) connect to the Arduino Board Digital 13
The LED short leg (-) connect to the Arduino Board GND
